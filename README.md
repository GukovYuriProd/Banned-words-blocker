# Banned-words-blocker
This project was created to explore methods for blocking banned words on the screen or in the audio of live broadcasts. The target audience is streamers who receive donations through voiceovers or explore “unsafe” sites. If you want to receive the full code of the project for commercial purposes or offer cooperation, then write to my email.
